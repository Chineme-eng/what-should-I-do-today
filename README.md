# 🎲 What Should I Do Today?

A small, chaotic, surprisingly comforting web app that tells you what to do today.

Sometimes it’s practical.  
Sometimes it’s silly.  
Sometimes it’s uncomfortably specific.

You click a button. It tells you something. That’s it.

## 🧠 Why This Exists

Because decision fatigue is real.  
Because “do nothing” is still doing something.  
Because sometimes you just need a tiny nudge — not a life plan.
